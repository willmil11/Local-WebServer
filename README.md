Put your html files in the Files folder

To customise 404 error message: Replace the default page in the 404 folder with a custom 404 page
[The custom 404 page must be named '404.html' to work]

To run the server execute in a cmd 'node webserver.js' while being in the Webserver directory, you need to run this as root [Don't worry, I patched every security problems :)]

If you have trouble using the Webserver:

Enjoy !
